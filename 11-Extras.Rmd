# Alternating Conditional Expectations

## Alternating Conditional Expectations

Additive model:
$$y = \alpha + \sum_{j=1}^p f_j(x_j) + \varepsilon$$

Transform-both-sides model:
$$\theta(y) = \alpha + \sum_{j=1}^p f_j(x_j) + \varepsilon$$

ACE is a way of fitting TBS models to minimize
$$ \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ \theta(y_i) -  \alpha - \sum_{j=1}^p f_j(x_{j,i}) \right]$$

\pause

 * To avoid $\theta=\alpha=f_j=0$, we restrict $\theta$ such that $\text{Var}(\theta(y))=1$.

## Alternating Conditional Expectations

1. Initialize
  $$ \theta(y) = \frac{y-\bar{y}}{\text{SD}(y)}, \qquad f_j = \hat{\beta}_j (x_j-\bar{x}), \qquad \alpha=0$$

2. Cycle
\begin{align*}
  f_j &= S(x_j, \theta(y) - \sum_{i\ne j} f_j(x_i)) \\
  \theta &= S(y, \sum_j f_j(x_j) \\
  \theta(y) &\leftarrow \frac{\theta(y)-\bar{\theta(y)}}{\text{SD}(\theta(y))}
\end{align*}

## Alternating Conditional Expectations

 * Can over-fit easily
 * Hard to produce predictions (as you have to reverse transformations)
 * Perhaps best for suggesting parametric transformations
 * Can also be viewed as a method for maximizing partial correlations between $\theta(y)$ and $f_j(x_j)$.

#  Additivity and Variance Stabilization

##  Additivity and Variance Stabilization

AVAS is another transform-both-sides method.

Minimize
$$ \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ \theta(y_i) -  \alpha - \sum_{j=1}^p f_j(x_{j,i}) \right]$$
such that
$$\text{Var}\left[\theta(y) \mid \sum_{j=1}^p f_j(x_{j,i}) \right] = \text{constant}$$

 * Additive with homoskedastic errors.
 * Not necessarily the best possible fit.
 * Again, it is perhaps best for suggesting parametric transformations

\alert{GAMMs:}

* Random effects
* Smooth additive predictors
* Non-Gaussian response distribution

# Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines

## Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines

Special case of additive models with regression splines and interactions
$$\hat{f}(x) = \sum_{j=1}^k c_j B_j(x)$$
where $B_j(x)$ are formed from products of terms of the form $[\pm (x_i-t)^q_+]$

 * Usually $q=1$ (piecewise linear)
 * Estimated iteratively with terms and knots being added at each step.
 * Developed by Jerome Friedman (1991).

## Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines

 * Available in R in the `earth` package (as MARS was trademarked).
 * Default uses only additive predictors (no interactions) and chooses model size using GCV.
 * Set `degree=2` to allow second-order interactions
 * Set `nk=?` to restrict model size (number of knots).
