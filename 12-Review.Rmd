# Key Concepts

\fontsize{13}{15}\sf

 * Sample space of conditional response (Reals, Positive Reals, Non-negative counts, 0/1, proportions, \dots)
 * Nature of predictors (numerical, categorical, random)
 * Relationship between response and predictors (linear, additive, interacting, nesting)

 1. LM: Linear models
 2. GLM: Generalized Linear Models
 3. GLMM: Generalized Linear Mixed-Effect Models
 4. GAM: Generalized Additive Models
 5. GAMM: Generalized Additive Mixed-Effect Models

# Data Analysis Skills

 * Interpreting graphs
 * Appropriate plots to highlight relationships (e.g., interactions)
 * Transformations to allow linear models
 * Transformations to limit prediction space
 * Dealing with outliers
 * Bootstrap
 * Permutation tests

# Linear Models

\fontsize{13}{15}\sf

 * Interactions between 2 numerical predictors
 * Interactions between a numerical and categorical predictor
 * Outliers
 * Leverage
 * Cook's distance
 * Residual diagnostics
 * Partial residual plots
 * F-tests
 * QQ plots
 * LOO residuals
 * Cross-validation

# General Linear Models

\fontsize{13}{15}\sf

 * Logistic regression, log-odds interpretations
 * Binomial regression
 * Poisson regression
 * Negative binomial regression
 * Beta regression
 * Over/under dispersion and quasi likelihood
 * Deviance residuals
 * $\chi^2$ tests for deviance
 * Confidence intervals using profile likelihood regions
 * AIC
 * Zero-inflated models
 * Exponential family distributions
 * Link functions, canonical link functions

# General Linear Mixed-Effects Models

 * When to use a random effect?
 * Nesting and grouping
 * Panel/longitudinal data
 * REML and MLE
 * Interpreting a fitted model
 * Bootstrap tests

# Generalized Additive Models

\fontsize{13}{15}\sf

 * Kernel and local polynomial regression
 * Smoothing splines
 * Regression splines
 * Penalized regression splines
 * Mixed model representation of penalized regression splines
 * Curse of dimensionality
 * Linear smoothers and degrees of freedom
 * F test for linearity
 * GCV and smoothness selection
 * Additive models
 * Generalized additive models

# Exam

* Closed book, calculators permitted. But only HP 10b11+ calculators as per faculty policy. 
* Five questions: $16+25+16+28+ 15 = 100$ marks.
* You will need to interpret lots of R output, but only 1 mark is associated with writing R code.
* Focus on data analysis, modelling and interpretation.
* Emphasis on what we actually use for modelling, not on the theory that led up to it.

# Theory Questions

 * Show something is in the exponential family
 * Derive the canonical link function
 * Write down the model given the R output, or a description of response and predictors.
 
# Consultation Times

 * Tomorrow, 4--5pm
 * Monday 23rd, 4--5pm
 * Tuesday 24th, 4--5pm
 * Monday 30th, 4--5pm
 * Tuesday 31st, 4--5pm
